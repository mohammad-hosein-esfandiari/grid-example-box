This is a grid-based page where I used a to-do list, quiz app, filtering box, and a game. 
This project was my practice exercise to improve my programming skills, and I have written all the logic in a straightforward manner without using any packages. 
I aimed to make my code as clean as possible.
( I am working on this project right now )
